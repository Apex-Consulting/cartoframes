## Quickstart

### About this Guide

### Installing CARTOframes

You can install CARTOframes with `pip`. Simply type the following in the command line to do a system install:

```bash
$ pip install cartoframes
```
To install through a Jupyter notebook, you can run

```bash
!pip install cartoframes
```

It is recommended to install cartoframes in a [virtual environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/). For example, you can run the the following command line commands to create a virtual env, activate it, and install cartoframes:

```bash
$ virtualenv cfenv
$ source cfenv/bin/activate
(cfenv) $ pip install cartoframes
```

You'll notice the virtual environment name in your command line prompt, like above. Type `deactivate` to exit the virtualenv:

```bash
(cfenv) $ deactivate
```

### Installing Jupyter notebook

To install Jupyter, type:

```bash
$ pip install jupyter
```

If working in a virtual environment, make sure you have activated the environment first.

### Starting Jupyter notebook

Start up a Jupyter notebook with the following command:

```bash
$ jupyter notebook
```

After you type that command, you will see the notebook server starting up and a browser window with the directory contents open.

Next, create a new notebook. See Jupyter's [running a notebook](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html#running) for more information.
