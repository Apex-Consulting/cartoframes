## Introduction

These guides gets you set up with cartoframes by installing cartoframes, working in a Jupyter notebook, reading data from CARTO into your Python session, writing data to your CARTO account, and visualizing the data. They cover also how to use Helper Methods to create default meaningful visualizations and how to publish and share them.

All the guides are based in our set of [Notebook Examples](#TODO), which can be also used as an starting point to learn CARTOframes if you're already familiar with the environment.
