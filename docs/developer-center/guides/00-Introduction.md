## Introduction

Use these guides to learn about integrating CARTOframes into your data science workflows. Working inside of a Jupyter notebook, the guides walk through initial set-up and installation, reading data from CARTO into your Python session, writing data to your CARTO account, and the basics of visualizing your data on a map. We also cover how to use a series of Helper Methods to create meaningful visualizations that can be published and shared.

If you're already familiar with Jupyter Notebooks, you can also take a look to our [Notebook Examples](https://github.com/CartoDB/cartoframes/blob/master/examples) which can be also used as a starting point to learn CARTOframes.
