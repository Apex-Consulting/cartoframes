Interactive CARTO VL Maps
=========================

Interactive CARTO VL maps are the recommended way to create maps in cartoframes. These maps have a powerful API which exposes many features of the CARTO VL mapping library, including automatic legend generation. With the use of the helper functions, maps are created with great cartographic defaults out-of-the-box and include legends and popups automatically.
