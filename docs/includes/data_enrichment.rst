Data Enrichment
---------------

With CARTOframes it is possible to enrich your data by using our `Data Observatory <#data-observatory>`__
Catalogue through the enrichment methods.

**Important:** Since the data enrichment depends on the Data Observatory 2.0,
is only accessible to selected CARTO Enterprise users in a private beta.
We're still open to more beta testers, so if you're interested,
`please get in touch. <#https://carto.com/contact/?campaign_details=data-observatory-betatester>`__
