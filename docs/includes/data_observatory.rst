Data Observatory
----------------

With CARTOframes it is possible to enrich your data by using our `Data Observatory <#data-observatory>`__
Catalog through the enrichment methods.

**Important:** The new Data Observatory 2.0 is accessible to selected CARTO Enterprise
users in a private beta. We're still open to more beta testers, so if you're interested,
`please get in touch. <https://carto.com/contact/?campaign_details=data-observatory-betatester>`__
